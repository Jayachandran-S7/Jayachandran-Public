hi
this to check git push works through alias name 
command syntax as " git remote add <alias name> <HttpsLink> "

sample as : git remote add origin https://github.com/Jayachandran-S7/Jayachandran-Public.git

so going forward, we use " git push origin "
follow this u can give username and password to push changes from local into Remote


this is how we push changes from LOCAL to REMOTE


it's simply shortcut 

for push command " git push origin" is default command

check for GIT REVERT
